# Alx Low Level Programming

This repository contains programs written in C for my Low Level Programming projects in ALX software engineering curriculum. Topics covered in these projects include data structures (e.g. arrrays, linked lists, binary trees), algorithms (e.g. searching, sorting) and more.
